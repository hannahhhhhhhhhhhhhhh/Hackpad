# Why I made this
  I have never made any hardware stuff, and making a tiny keyboard is so cool. I really wanted to do this and design something on my own.
  This is my first time touching the schematics, modeling, and all these components. I had to download the apps including kicad, Fusion360 and VScode!
  I had trouble installing because a), my laptop is out of storage, and it is simply not good enough to run these apps, and b), I had to call Fusion360 because they somehow would not verify that I am a student. I ended up just getting a normal trial instead of a student plan. 

I learned how to use these softwares from scratch, as well as how the components work and what I need to do. The tutorial helped a LOT, and after understanding what I'm supposed to do, I also added my own things to my hackpad:D
Getting used to Fusion360 was a pain, especially with my laptop constantly freezing and killing itself.
